			The Cowells love animals and always will, they have been living in the Craighurst area for over ten years now and love it. Pam started breeding birds as a hobby about five years ago.
		She enjoyed it a lot and did quite well selling her birds. This hobby led to a two year stint working at a Barrie pet store. Pam learned a lot in the job. The experience reawakened a 
		longtime dream of hers, to own her own pet store. She started looking for a likely location and decided on 3571 Penetanguishene Road.
		Pam and her family have done lots of work on the store while maintaining the character of the old home. 
		<br><br>
			The Whistle Stop Pet Shop opened November 6th, 2010.
		Pamela's aim is to create the old fashioned pet store many of us remember from our youth. A general store for pets with a range of available pets and supplies and 
		pets who live on site. She stocks many local and Canadian Products and has worked hard at keeping her pricing comparable to larger pet store chains.
		The store is very well stocked for a small shop just starting out, and if Pam doesn't stock your pet's preferred food she will be happy to order and keep it
		in stock for you. She also offers wing and nail clipping for birds, small animal nail clipping, pet tags and equine plate engraving onsite. Pam and her family
		have created a really fun spot and a great local service that pet owners should be exited about and supportive of.
